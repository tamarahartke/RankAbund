# RankAbund

An R package including ...spec.ranks... to calculate ranks from a species abundance matrix, by a grouping variable, and ...ra.plot... to plot rank abundance curves in ggplot.

## License
This package is released under [GNU General Public License 3](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-3).

## Development
Please let me know something doesn not work or you have an idea for how it could be better.
At the moment this is a private project, but will probably go public by the end of 2019. Some things I might change for the next version: make the vector of colours for plotting optional, make the y-axis more flexible, and find a more elegant way to go from the listed dataframes to the plot.

## Installation

Install this package in R using ...devtools::install_github("tamarahartke/RankAbund")
