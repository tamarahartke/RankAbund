# RankAbund

An R package including ```spec.ranks``` to calculate ranks from a species abundance matrix by a grouping variable, and ```ra.plot``` to plot rank abundance curves in ggplot.

Changes in version 0.2.0: 
- fixed a class problem which kept [ra.plot()] from reading the list of dataframes generated by [spec.ranks()] under R v4.X (Thank you to Andr√© Junggebauer for discovering this problem!)
- grouping variable for [ra.plot()] is now inferred from the list of dataframes for plotting, not supplied separately
- default colour palette for [ra.plot()]
- added capital letters to the axis titles
